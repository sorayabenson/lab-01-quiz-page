                    Printmaking is so rad! It is a craft that has so many different possibilities and techniques. Each
                    technique has it's own texture and language.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are so many different techniques:
                <ul>
                    <li>Intaglio</li>
                    <li>Relief</li>
                    <li>Risograph</li>
                    <li>Screenprinting</li>
                    <li>Letterpress</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                But let me tell you about my favorite one to work with, relief. Relief printing uses an image carved
                into a
                block
                that you then apply ink to, and pull it off with paper.

                <h2>Carve</h2>
                <p>
                    With relief printing you can use any design you can imagine, from the most minimal to the most
                    intricate.
                    You can use wood blocks or linoleum to carve the design into. Wood has a great natural texture,
                    while
                    linoleum holds fine details beautifully.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To transfer the design on to the block you can use transfer paper between the design and the block
                    and
                    trace over the lines lightly. Another method is to print the image on a laser printer, tape the
                    fresh
                    print to
                    the block face down and lightly rub the back of the paper with acetone or alcohol to transfer the
                    image.
                    Once the design is on the block you can use a sharpie to mark your lines more clearly to guide you
                    while
                    you carve.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once the design is on the block it is time to carve! To carve you can use linoleum and woodcarving
                    tools. This part is so relaxing. When you carve you are removing the negative space of the design,
                    you
                    are carving out the 'white' of the image. This part is the heartbeat of the piece. Play with how you
                    make your marks, the way the lines interact with each other. Take your time. And most importantly
                    keep
                    your free hand <i>behind</i> your carving tool, dont accidently slice your fingers!
                </p>

            <section class="topic ink">
                <h2>Ink</h2>
                <p>
                    Once the block is carved it is time to ink it up! Use a piece of glass to mix your ink on with a
                    paint
                    spatula. Find the colors you love and keep mixing. You want the ink to be warm and pliable.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To roll the ink out, make a line of ink with the spatula the width of the brayer. Take the brayer
                    and
                    charge it up with ink and roll it out in a nice square. Build up the ink square by adding more ink
                    until
                    you have a nice <i>orange peel texture.</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And now it's time to ink your block! Roll the brayer over the block starting at one side and making
                    your
                    way across to the next. Recharge the brayer and roll the ink starting from a different corner. Build
                    up
                    the ink on the block layer by layer until it has the same texture as the ink pad.

                <h2>Print</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's pause and talk paper. Paper options are limitless. Lighter weight papers like Masa and
                    Mulberry
                    are great for pulling a print by hand, while heavier papers like Rives BFK or Hahnem√ºhle are really
                    nice
                    to work with on a printing press.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To finally print your image gently roll the paper onto the inked block and smooth it lightly with
                    your
                    hand, being very careful to not shift it on the block. Cover the paper with another piece of paper
                    to
                    protect the final print.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm going to explain how to handpull the print, because it is so accessible. To apply pressure and
                    transfer the ink to the paper you can use a barren or a <i>simple wooden spoon.</i> Press and move
                    in
                    firm but gentle circles over the block. It takes quite a few passovers to fully print the image. You
                    can
                    peak to see how much of the ink has printed by rolling up a corner.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once you get the feeling that you've pulled all the ink from the block, carefully roll the paper off
                    the
                    block and admire your sweet baby. Hang to dry, it takes a couple days.
